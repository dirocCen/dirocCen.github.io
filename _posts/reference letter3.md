Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a faculty from department of physics, South China University of Technology (SCUT), Guangzhou, majoring in Statistical Physics and Quantum Mechanics. He showed great interest in the physics courses I taught, which impresses me a lot.

Yu-Jie joined our group for about three years and he studied topics in the field of computational condense matter physics during this time. His main research topic is ground state structure search. His main research topic is ground state structure search, which is a very important topic in solid state physics and has significance for the understanding of structural diversity. Yujie's research calculate the convex hulls in the parameter space, and the designed algorithm increases the space dimension that can be solved. His research methods are very helpful for high-throughput first-principles alloy structure screening.


He has good communication and academic writing skills and has the potential to be a good PhD candidate. I sincerely recommend him for the Ph.D candidate position in your institute. 


Sincerely,  
Yao Yao
