Dear  Prof. Titus Neupert,


With reference to the information listed on the open position web page, I am writing to express my interest in the PhD position in quantum condensed matter theory.
I will completed my master's degree with a specialization in computational condensed matter physics in June 2023.


To shortly introduce myself, my name is Yu-Jie Cen, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree at South China University of Technology. 
In my master thesis, I study the ground state structures of alloys at the atomic scale which is closely related with the prediction of high performance materials. Based on the interactions model of atom classification model and convex hulls analysis, we screen the possible ground state candidates from the whole configuration space. The core of my works is to design an algorithm to reclassify the structures according to symmetry and calculate the vertex structures in the correlation functions space. The result has been published in Physical Review Materials. 
<!-- Besides, I have the experience in standardized high-throughput first-principle calculation in VASP software.  -->

Besides, I am interesting in using machine learning to solve physics problems. A well-trained machine learning model may be able to combine the strengths of different structures to predict a new high-performing material. I have the experience in write a high-entropy alloys crystal generator containing many-body interactions based on supervised Learning with neural networks model in python.

In addition, I have the experience in teamwork to complete a big project.
I participated in the SAGAR software developed by our group in Python (http://sagar.compphys.cn/sagar), and I am responsible for the module B2 and B3.


 My enclosed transcript records and resume demonstrates my professional and academic history. If you need any additional information, you can reach me at my phone number (086-15521284374) or E-mail (202020129949@mail.scut.edu.cn). Thank you for your time and consideration.  



Sincerely,  
Yu-Jie, Cen
