Dear Admissions Committee Members,  

I am pleased to recommend Yu-Jie, Cen for the PhD position at your institution.  


I am Dr. Yang Xiao-Bao and I am a faculty member in South China University of Technology, majoring in computational material science. I have known Yu-Jie for the past 3 years since he became my master's student.  


We further developed the ACM model which is a work try to determine all the possible ground states in alloys. During the project, Yu-Jie demonstrated great enthusiasm and self-driven ability in his academic work. He gave a particularly interesting in building model and showed insight on key issues. He is also interested in programming and has contributed to some modules of the SAGAR website in our group. 




He has improved consistently every year and is a deserving candidate for the PhD position. I would be delighted if my recommendation helps him obtain admission.
