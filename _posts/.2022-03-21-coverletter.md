Dear Professor XXX:

<!-- I am writing to apply for the position of Phd on website on 1 October 2022.  -->

<!-- 目前的情况，在研三2023.6月毕业，对你们的课题组感兴趣 -->
<!-- My name is Yujie, Cen, I am currently in my second year of graduate school, and I am expected to graduate in June 2023. -->
My name is Yujie, Cen, a M.S. candidate in Computational Condensed Matter Physics Group at South China University of Technelogy.
I am writing this letter to ask whether your lab is recruting an incoming Ph.D student next year.



<!-- 展示我的能力，对你们的什么研究感兴趣 -->
I learned about your research group from ..., I am interested in your direction with .... 
<!-- 展示一下你读过对方的文章，并且提出一些理解 -->
<!-- I have read your paper X, Y and Z  -->
I briefly describe my situation. My current research direction is material computing/computing condensed matter, and the specific keywords are ground state structures search, high-throughput first-principles calculation, and machine learning.
I have an article published in PR Materials "Determining ground states of alloys by a symmetry-based classification". Currently I am working on a topic on using supervised learning to improve the efficiency of "special quasirandom structures" generation in high entropy alloys. A detailed resume is attached.


I look forward to your favourable reply.  

Best Regards,

YuJie, Cen
