Dear Prof. Kunihiko Kaneko,


To shortly introduce myself, my name is Yu-Jie Cen, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree at South China University of Technology. I will completed my master's degree with a specialization in computational condensed matter physics in June 2023. 
With reference to the information listed on the Copenhagen vacancies web page, I am writing to express my interest in the Biocomplexity PhD position.



With experience in atomic scale simulation and using machine learning models, I am very interested in statistical physics and numerical computing.
In my master thesis, I study the ground state structures of alloys at the atomic scale which is closely related with the prediction of high performance materials. Based on the interactions model of atom classification model and convex hulls analysis, we screen the possible ground state candidates from the whole configuration space. The core of my works is to design an algorithm to reclassify the structures according to symmetry and calculate the vertex structures in the correlation functions space. The result has been published in Physical Review Materials. More information can see in [Phys. Rev. Materials 6, L050801](https://journals.aps.org/prmaterials/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.L050801).


Another work is to build a special quasirandom structures (SQS) crystal generator containing many-body interactions in high-entropy alloys based on supervised learning with neural networks model in python. The inverse problem of mapping a feature vector to a crystal structure is a typical NP problem. We fix the lattice cell and randomly generate the crystal structures and feature vectors as training dataset. Using the SQS feature vectors as input for prediction, we get the approximate SQS structures. More information can see in this page [https://diroccen.github.io/2022-06/a2](https://diroccen.github.io/2022-06/a2).


I lack a background in biological systems, but I am also interested in exploring the fundamental questions in life science. 
Although the scale and principle of biological systems are not close to my previous research, I think that my experience of modeling and programming will be helpful to the research topic.


In addition, I also have the experience in teamwork to complete a crystallographic calculation software.
I participated in the SAGAR developed by our group in Python ([http://sagar.compphys.cn/sagar](http://sagar.compphys.cn/sagar)), and I am responsible for the module B2 and B3.


I hope to have the opportunity to communicate with you further. Thank you for your time and consideration.  
<!-- I am interesting in developing models in semiconductor devices interfaces.  -->



Best regrads,   
Yu-Jie, Cen
