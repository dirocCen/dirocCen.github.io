# Background

According to our previous work, we know that the structures with low Wyckoffs Position are very likely to be the stable ground state structures of the material at zero temperature. If we fix a lattice (such as fcc, bcc) and generate all structures with low Wyckoffs Position in advance (maybe only have less than 4 or 6 unequivalent atoms), we can use them as templates for high-throughput calculations, which can greatly reduce the calculation cost, especially for multicomponent alloys.
<!-- 根据我们之前的工作，我们知道低维克夫位点的结构非常有可能是材料零温下稳定的基态结构。如果固定一个格子（例如fcc,bcc）我们能提前生成所有的具有低维克夫位点的结构（也许是只具有4/6个以下的不等价原子），以此作为高通量计算的模板，可以大大地节约计算的成本，尤其是对于多元合金来说。 -->


<!-- 基于一些研究组的努力，通过扩胞，替换原子，根据对称性检查重复等操作，目前可以做到遍历生成所有对称不等价的结构。但随着原子数的增加和元素种类的增加，不等价的结构数目会急剧地增大，如下图： -->
Through operations such as expanding supercell, replacing atoms, and checking repetitions according to symmetry, it is currently possible to enumerate and generate all non-equivalent derivative structures. However, as the supercell atoms number increases and the types of elements increase, the number of derivative structures will increase sharply, as shown in the figure below:

It is obviously select the structures with low Wyckoffs position in such a large number of candidate structures is extremely inefficient. Therefore, we developed a method based on the symmetric operator subgroup decomposition, which can directly generate the structures with low Wyckoffs position without enumerate all structures.
<!-- 在这样庞大的候选结构中选取低维克夫位点的结构显然是效率极低的。于是我们发展了一种基于对称操作表子群的方式，可以直接生成低低维克夫位点结构的方法。 -->


# Main works
The algorithm flow is as follows:
1. Expanding the cell, and calculate the symmetry operation table (permutation group) under the pure phase of this supercell, which is the largest symmetry operation permutation group under this supercell.

2. Computing all nonconjugate subgroups of the permutation group.

3. Classifying the atoms according to these non-conjugated subgroups.

4. Carry out atomic replacement according to the result of subgroup classification to generate structures.


<!-- 具体的步骤如下：
1. 扩胞，并计算该超胞的纯相下的对称操作表（置换群）,这是该超胞下最大的对称操作置换群。

2. 计算该置换群的所有非共轭子群。

3. 根据这些非共轭的子群对原子进行分类。

4. 根据子群分类的结果进行原子替换，生成结构。 -->
