Dear Prof. Kai Nordlund,


With reference to the information listed on website, I am writing to express my interest in the PhD position in ab initio electronic transport simulations.
I will completed my master's degree with a specialization in computational condensed matter physics in June 2023, and the doctoral program of modelling the interactions between energetic particles is exactly what I am interesting in.  



To shortly introduce myself, my name is Yu-Jie, Cen, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree at South China University of Technology. 
In my master thesis, I study the ground state structures of alloys at the atomic scale which is closely related with the prediction of high performance materials. Based on the interactions model of atom classification model and convex hulls analysis, we screen the possible ground state candidates from the whole configuration space. The core of my works is to design an algorithm to reclassify the structures according to symmetry and calculate the vertex structures in the correlation functions space. The result has been published in Physical Review Materials. 
Besides, I am interesting in using machine learning algorithms to solve some physics problems. A well trained machine learning potentials model cost fast less than the ab initio calculation. I have read some papers and code for constructing the machine learning potentials from building the descriptors to training the neural network models. I think my background and skills may be helpful to what the research topic demands.  



 My enclosed transcript records and resume demonstrates my professional and academic history. If you need any additional information, you can reach me at my phone number (086-15521284374) or E-mail (202020129949@mail.scut.edu.cn). Thank you for your time and consideration.  



Sincerely,  
Yu-Jie, Cen
