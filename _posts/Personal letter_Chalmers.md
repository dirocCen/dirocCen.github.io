Dear  Prof. Julia Wiktor,


#### Self introduction

To shortly introduce myself, my name is Yu-Jie Cen, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree at South China University of Technology. I will completed my master's degree with a specialization in computational condensed matter physics in June 2023. 
With reference to the information listed on the Chalmers vacancies web page, I am writing to express my interest in the PhD position in Modelling of Interfaces in Solar Cells and Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors.



#### Previous experience of relevance for the position

At the undergraduate period, I took a degree in Applied Physics. I participated in China Undergraduate Mathematical in Model (CUMCM) and China Undergraduate Physics Tournament (CUPT).
 The experience of participating in CUPT for a year and a half has had a great impact on me. The whole process of literature research, modeling, simulation, experiment, group meeting makes me gradually interested in dong research. And finally continue to study for a master's degree in computational physics.
<!-- Autually, many of the topics in the tournament are no easier than the formal research of my master's degree. -->



In my master thesis, I study the ground state structures of alloys at the atomic scale which is closely related with the prediction of high performance materials. Based on the interactions model of atom classification model and convex hulls analysis, we screen the possible ground state candidates from the whole configuration space. The core of my works is to design an algorithm to reclassify the structures according to symmetry and calculate the vertex structures in the correlation functions space. The result has been published in Physical Review Materials. More information can see in [Phys. Rev. Materials 6, L050801](https://journals.aps.org/prmaterials/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.L050801).


Besides, I am interesting in using machine learning to solve physics problems. A well-trained machine learning model may be able to combine the strengths of different structures to predict a new high-performing material. I have the experience in write a special quasirandom structures (SQS) crystal generator containing many-body interactions in high-entropy alloys based on supervised learning with neural networks model in python. The inverse problem of mapping the feature vector to crystal structure is a typical NP problem. We fix the lattice cell and randomly generate the crystal structure and feature vector as training dataset. Using the SQS feature vector as input for prediction, we get the approximate SQS structure. More information can see in this page [https://diroccen.github.io/2022-06/a2](https://diroccen.github.io/2022-06/a2).


Another work is about the structural stability of 2D boron plane. Because the valence electrons of boron are 5, the pattern of 2D boron plane is very complicated unlike 2D carbon planar graphite. The boron plane will have vacancy defects based on triangular lattice. There are some generalized rules like 2 vacancies cannot be connected together or the structure will be unstable. Using these rules we assemble the structures just like a jigsaw games. Right now we can assemble a crystal structures which primitive cell has approximately 100 atoms and the energy is pretty close to the lowest energy.



In addition, I have the experience in teamwork to complete a big project.
I participated in the SAGAR software developed by our group in Python ([http://sagar.compphys.cn/sagar](http://sagar.compphys.cn/sagar)), and I am responsible for the module B2 and B3.


#### Future goals and future research focus

I wish I could be an academic after PhD, but I'm also happy to keep other options open.
I think the PhD project in modeling of interfaces in semiconductor devices is the best fit for my academic and career. I think interface modeling and simulation will play a key role in this project. 
I have learned some descriptor construction methods in the related paper on machine learning that can convert structure into features, which might be helpful for modeling surfaces.
