      title: '📚 My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My research focuses on the intersection of materials science and computational physics. I specialize in using first-principles calculations to investigate the fundamental properties of materials.

        My key areas of interest include:
        - **Heat Transport:** Understanding and predicting thermal properties in complex and quasi-1D systems.
        - **Phonon Dynamics:** Studying lattice vibrations and their behavior in nanomaterials, particularly through symmetry-adapted approaches as part of the PULGON project.
        - **Machine Learning:** Applying machine learning techniques to accelerate and enhance materials discovery and property prediction.
        
        I am always open to new collaborations and discussions. Please feel free to reach out.
